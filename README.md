Development Boilerplate for React Projects with API server

**Live Demo:** https://joel-bentley-fcc-starter.herokuapp.com/

This code is designed to be used with the Free Code Camp full-stack challenges.

This boilerplate uses create-react-app for client side development.

Project is inspired by clementinejs and hackathon-starter boilerplate projects.
Oauth code borrows from megaboilerplate and provides Github login.

To use, first add .env files in root and /client. These files require info from Oauth application setup on your Github account.
Use yarn to install dependencies within root and /client directories.

For development, type 'npm run dev'

For production, First run 'npm run build' within /client, then run 'npm start' from root.
